# Blockchain for Post-election audit

## Post-election audit

Election audits are critical to ensuring the integrity of election outcomes and for raising voter confidence. Auditing can demonstrate the validity of an election outcome and provide an indication of errors in ballot tabulation.

An evidence-based election would produce not only a reported (or initial) election outcome, but also evidence that the reported outcome is correct. This evidence may be examined in a “recount” or in a “post-election audit” to provide assurance that the reported outcome indeed is the result of a correct tabulation of cast ballots.

However, post-election audits are vulnerable to inaccuracy without proper voting machinery in place.

Experts agree that reliable post-election audits are only possible with a paper trail. This means that voting machines that only record votes electronically (often via touchscreen) are not suitable for ensuring election integrity.

The safest voting machines use optical scan paper ballot systems. In these systems, voters mark their votes by filling in an oval on a paper ballot. Then the paper ballot is scanned by a machine at the polling place and digitized for electronic tabulation.

Today, there is no national mandate requiring paper ballot systems in the United States. States such as Georgia, New Jersey, Nevada, and others do not have a paper trail to follow post-election.

A new bill called the Protecting American Votes and Elections Act proposes that all state and local elections must ensure voter-verified paper ballots can be audited.

The bill also wants all federal elections to be subject to post-election audits.

The most reliable and cost-effective post-election audits are known as risk-limiting audits. Essentially, these test only the number of ballots needed to mathematically determine the accuracy of election outcomes.

Risk-limiting audits rely on hand-calculating the margin of victory to proportionally determine the number of ballots that need to be audited. Risk-limiting audits are new and adoption is not standard across election jurisdictions.

## Post-election audits on the blockchain

With a public blockchain, each voter would be allowed to audit each ballot to confirm that reported vote totals are accurate, without revealing the identity or vote choice of each voter.

Today, the blockchain voting startups Votem and Voatz offer systems that enable voters to verify their own votes.

Voters cast ballots and receive QR codes tied to their vote. By scanning the QR code with another device, voters can reassure themselves that their vote was properly recorded. The system does not let voters know with certainty that their vote was part of the final election result, but no form of voting currently in use offers that level of assurance.

On a public blockchain, voters would know how many voters there had been. They could check that all votes had been counted, without knowing what the actual vote was or the identity of the voter. They would be able to check that their own votes had been correctly allocated. They would do this via the QR code tied to their own votes.
